# Front-End

There are many skills we want to review when interviewing a candidate. We aim to target libraries and tools that we use, including:

- General react experience
- CSS
- styled-components
- React hooks
- Redux
- Redux middleware
- Typescript

### Q1 - Tell me about the last project you used react on, why you used it, and what tools you used.

This question aims to give the interviewee a question that they can answer immediately without trouble, in the aim of breaking the ice, cooling any nerves there may be. It can lead into discussions about other FE frameworks, why they like react, etc, but this question really just serves as an opener.

### Q2 - What parts of React frustrates you?

This aims to get knowledge of their understanding of the framework. We could phrase this positively, “what DO you like”, but thats hard to think of on the spot. Frustrations with the language are something you know and will talk about as an engineer, so it should be easier to talk about.

**Targeted Skills:**

- Core react experience

### Q3 - What is your go-to state management tool when writing a React app?

State management is a huge topic in React. To do an in-person interview that can cover common areas of React as well as something like redux would be difficult. This question allows us to identify which state management libraries they have experience with, as well as an opportunity to flex their knowledge. 

We would look for an engineer to be able to know that it depends on the application. A good applicant would identify that redux isnt always necessary, and that react context or even hooks would be sufficient for smaller or less complicated applications.

**Targeted Skills:**

- React hooks
- Redux
- Saga/Thunk

### Q4 - Do you prefer to write React in Javascript or Typescript?

Pretty simple one to gauge their preference and experience with Typescript. As we move over our own codebase to TS, we want to know if this is something they can help us with.

**Targeted Skills:**

- Typescript
